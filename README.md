# Labjack_Camera_Trigger
Matlab functions for generating TTL pulse sequences via a USB DAQ device.

As written, will interface with an attached LabJack U3-LV to produce precisely TTL pulses capable of triggering CMOS cameras (e.g. Mightex BTE-BO50-U). Allows the user to specify complex TTL sequences.
